This repository contains the tutorials which can be opened in Google Colab on www.simulatetomorrow.com.
The tutorials are about applying computational methods from various areas of research and industry to problems that relate to UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Each tutorial contains an explanation of a computational method and the problem to which it is being applied, along with prompts to write code and feedback on 
the code that has been written.
There are also completed versions of the tutorials available, so that non-coders may see the same ideas in action.
