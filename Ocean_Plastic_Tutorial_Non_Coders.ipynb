Advection is the transport of something by the motion of a fluid into which it is introduced. In the case of ocean plastic, the plastics whose motion we are trying to predict are advected by ocean currents and wind.\n","\n","Essentially, advection states that when particles of a fluid are placed in a moving fluid, the particles of the newly introduced fluid will stay stationary with respect to the fluid around them - from the perspective of somebody watching from outside of the fluid, this means that the newly introduced fluid will move with the same flow as the fluid into which it has been introduced.\n","\n","We will think of plastic in the ocean as a fluid - ocean plastic is made up of many small particles which can move around independently and mix, so it has all the properties of what we call fluids."],"metadata":{"id":"O8KYAeV1v0Ps"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Euler vs. Lagrange\n","\n","There are two main ways of considering fields in compuational fluid dynamics - the Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints.\n","\n","The Eulerian viewpoint considers a grid dividing up the space into cells. Each cell then has a set of values associated with it, representing the values of the fluid's properties. Taking the grid to be made up of infinitely small cells gives an exact description of the fluid, but on a computer we have to decide on cells that are 'small enough'.\n","\n","The Lagrangian viewpoint of a fluid considers it as a collection of many parcels of the fluid. In this case, an exact description of the fluid would involve taking infinitely many parcels but we have to content ourselves with a 'big enough' number of parcels in practice.\n","\n","In theory, either viewpoint effectively describes the fluid - but we have to decide on our approach before we start working on our problem. The approach that will be taken here is as follows:\n","\n","- The velocity field (the flow of ocean currents) will be represented by an Eulerian field. This means we will have some part of the ocean split up into cells, with each cell having an arrow (called a vector) associated with it pointing in the direction of the flow of currents at that location in the ocean and with size proportional to the speed of the flow at that location.\n","\n","- The fluid of plastic particles will be represented by a Lagrangian set of parcels.\n","\n","This is the setup used in the Ocean Parcels library which we will use later.

Trajectory simulation is done using 'numerical integration'. The process of numerical integration is to decide on a small time step and using the speed and direction of currents at the starting location, figure out where the particle would be after the small time step (using speed $\\times$ time = distance). Then, we use the speed and direction of the current at the new location to find the location of the particle after the next time step and repeat the process thousands of times to follow the particle's trajectory, with smaller time steps giving more accurate results than larger time steps.\n","\n","Two variables are defined below: *time_step* (to store the size of the time step) and *num_steps* (to store the number of steps that will be taken).
