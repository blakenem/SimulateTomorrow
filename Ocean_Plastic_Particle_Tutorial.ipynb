Advection is the transport of something by the motion of a fluid into which it is introduced. In the case of ocean plastic, the plastics whose motion we are trying to predict are advected by ocean currents and wind.\n","\n","Now, to put concrete maths to the idea; the 'advection operator' is $ \\textbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla = u_x \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + u_z \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = \\frac{d}{dt}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\n","Clearly it describes a rate of change with respect to time and due to the presence of the velocity vector in the operator, it's apparent that the operator picks out the rate of change caused by the motion of the fluid. The '$\\textbf{u}$' here is the velocity field of the fluid - $\\textbf{u}(\\textbf{x},t)$ is a more exact way of writing it because it is a vector function of position and time, but it is commonly shortened to $\\textbf{u}$.\n","\n","If we have a plastic particle in the fluid at position $\\textbf{r}=x \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} + y \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} + z \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$, advection causes it to have velocity $(\\textbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\space \\textbf{r} = \\textbf{u}(\\textbf{r},t)$. Thus, if we know $\\textbf{r}(t_0)$ we can calculate the position of the particle at any later stage by\n","\n","$\\textbf{r}(t') = \\int \\limits_{t_0}^t' dt \\space \\textbf{u}(\\textbf{r}(t),t) + \\textbf{r}(t_0)$\n","\n","We will work through numerically integrating this to get trajectories in this tutorial, but first we must discuss how the velocity field and particle positions are represented in the model."],"metadata":{"id":"O8KYAeV1v0Ps"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Euler vs. Lagrange\n","\n","There are two main ways of considering fields in compuational fluid dynamics - the Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints.\n","\n","The Eulerian viewpoint considers a grid dividing up the space into cells. Each cell then has a set of values associated with it, representing the values of the fluid's properties. Numerically integrating the system then involves repeatedly updating the values of the fluid's properties in each cell. Taking the grid to be made up of infinitely small cells gives an exact description of the fluid, but on a computer we have to decide on cells that are 'small enough'.\n","\n","The Lagrangian viewpoint of a fluid considers it as a collection of many parcels of the fluid. Numerically integrating the system then involves repeatedly updating the positions of the parcels and the values of the fluids properties in a given parcel. In this case, an exact description of the fluid would involve taking infinitely maky parcels but we have to content ourselves with a 'big enough' number of parcels in practice.\n","\n","In theory, either viewpoint effectively describes the fluid - but we have to decide on our approach before we start working on our problem. The approach that will be taken here is as follows:\n","\n","- The velocity field $\\textbf{u}(\\textbf{x},t)$ will be represented by an Eulerian field.\n","\n","- The fluid of plastic particles will be represented by a Lagrangian set of parcels. $\\textbf{r}(\\textbf{x}_0,t)$ is the position (at time $t$) of the parcel that was at $\\textbf{x}_0$ at time $t_0$.\n","\n","Although this is the way that the problem was set up in the previous section '**Advection**', note that we could equivalently have set up the problem using only the Eulerian or only the Lagrangian specification of the fluids. If only the Eulerian specification was used, an additional property of the fluid, 'plastic density' would be associated with each cell in the Eulerian picture and we could evolve that to replicate the dynamics of plastics in the ocean.\n","\n","Alternatively, if only the Lagrangian specification was used, the velocity field $\\textbf{u}(\\textbf{x},t)$ that describes ocean currents would be replaced by $\\frac{d}{dt}\\textbf{X}(\\textbf{x}_0,t)$ - the time derivative of trajectories of fluid parcels, where these fluid parcels are seperate to the plastic parcels and represent instead moving portions of the ocean.\n","\n","We use the Eulerian specification for the velocity field and the Lagrangian specification for the plastic trajectories in this tutorial because that is the setup used in the Ocean Parcels library. The choice is advantageous because it allows for existing datasets of ocean currents in the Eulerian specification to be used to produce results for the trajectories of discrete particles which are most intuitively visualised in the Lagrangian specification."],"metadata":{"id":"hgULNfgH91Hl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Coding the advection of fluid parcels in an Eulerian specified field\n","\n","As mentioned earlier, this is the workhorse behind the models in the Ocean Parcels library.
